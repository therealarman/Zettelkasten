# The Zettlekasten Project - A solution to managing files, projects, field notes, and more!


## Hello! „Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØÔºÅ üëã

This is a work in progress!

The Zettlekasten project is an ongoing software project I'm developing in order to help myself stay organized among a sea of files. Right now, it's in the conceptual and early development stage, however as development continues I plan to tweak the features list below.

This project is heavily inspired by CyanVoxel's software, [TagStudio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTQeMkYRMcw). However I have some of my own ideas in mind to build upon CyanVoxel's already great program.

## Planned Features

- [ ] An attribute-value tag system as seen in TagStudio
- [ ] Obsidian Compatability
- [ ] A vault registration system that lets you group files into folders within the software regardless of their real locations
- [ ] A "literature" or "resources" section to link to and preview outside works and articles
